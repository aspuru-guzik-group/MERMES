This is an electrolysis reaction. Output a JSON dict for the standard conditions with the following keys: 
1) "anode material":  a string that describes the anode material, which is the positive end. Abbreviations may be used in the image.
2) "cathode material": a string that describes the cathode material, which is the negative end. Abbreviations may be used in the image.
3) "electrolytes": a string that describes all the electrolytes and additives for the reaction. Provide all equivalents, amounts and concentrations in brackets. 
4) "solvents": a string that describes all the solvents for the reaction. Provide all volumes and ratios in brackets. 
5) "current": a string that describes the current used.
6) "duration": a string that describes the duration of the reaction. 
7) "air/inert": a string that describes if the reaction is performed in air or under inert conditions. 
8) "temperature": a string that describes the temperature of the reaction. 
9) "others": a string that describes any other reaction conditions not included in the previous keys. 
In all the strings, only use information that are given. Put N.R. otherwise. Each compound should only appear once.
